HEAD KNIGHT:  Nee!
  Nee!
  Nee!
  Nee!
ARTHUR:  Who are you?
HEAD KNIGHT:  We are the Knights Who Say... Nee!
ARTHUR:  No!  Not the Knights Who Say Nee!
HEAD KNIGHT:  The same!
BEDEMIR:  Who are they?
HEAD KNIGHT:  We are the keepers of the sacred words:  Nee, Pen, and
  Nee-wom!
RANDOM:  Nee-wom!
ARTHUR:  Those who hear them seldom live to tell the tale!
HEAD KNIGHT:  The Knights Who Say Nee demand a sacrifice!
ARTHUR:  Knights of Nee, we are but simple travellers who seek the
  enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
HEAD KNIGHT:  Nee!  Nee!  Nee!  Nee!
ARTHUR and PARTY:  Oh, ow!
HEAD KNIGHT:  We shall say 'nee' again to you if you do not appease us.
ARTHUR:  Well, what is it you want?
HEAD KNIGHT:  We want... a shrubbery!
  [dramatic chord]
ARTHUR:  A what?
HEAD KNIGHT:  Nee!  Nee!
ARTHUR and PARTY:  Oh, ow!
ARTHUR:  Please, please!  No more!  We shall find a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT:  You must return here with a shrubbery or else you will
  never pass through this wood alive!
ARTHUR:  O Knights of Nee, you are just and fair, and we will return
  with a shrubbery.
HEAD KNIGHT:  One that looks nice.
ARTHUR:  Of course.
HEAD KNIGHT:  And not too expensive.
ARTHUR:  Yes.
HEAD KNIGHTS:  Now... go!
